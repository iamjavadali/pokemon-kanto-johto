# Pokémon Golden Yellow — Current Project State

**Document type:** Broad operational project snapshot  
**Project:** Pokémon Golden Yellow  
**Repository:** `iamjavadali/pokemon-kanto-johto`  
**Canonical working branch:** `prototype/v0.1`  
**Snapshot date:** August 27, 2026

# 1. Purpose

This document answers one question:

> **Where does Pokémon Golden Yellow broadly stand right now, and what is the next active development boundary?**

It is intentionally a high-level operational snapshot.

It does **not** serve as the permanent evidence record for individual gameplay acceptances, CI runs, ROM hashes, scene choreography, or fix-by-fix history.

Those details belong in:

- `Pokemon_Golden_Yellow_Acceptance_Log.md` for the cumulative acceptance history;
- dedicated acceptance records when a milestone is complex enough to require one, such as `Pokemon_Golden_Yellow_MtMoon_Acceptance_Record.md`.

The live `prototype/v0.1` repository remains authoritative for implementation state when this snapshot becomes stale.

# 2. Documentation Roles

The Golden Yellow documentation set has these distinct roles:

1. `Pokemon_Golden_Yellow_Project_Master.md` — overall project architecture and campaign direction.
2. `Pokemon_Golden_Yellow_Hard_Rules.md` — implementation rules and non-negotiable constraints.
3. `Pokemon_Golden_Yellow_Yellow_Unique_Specification.md` — Yellow-specific Kanto narrative requirements.
4. `Pokemon_Golden_Yellow_FireRed_Retention_Specification.md` — compatible FireRed/Gen III systems and presentation to retain.
5. `Pokemon_Golden_Yellow_Current_Project_State.md` — broad current development position.
6. `Pokemon_Golden_Yellow_Acceptance_Log.md` — canonical cumulative manual-acceptance ledger.
7. Dedicated acceptance records — deep implementation history for major milestones when warranted.

Current State must not duplicate the Acceptance Log in detail.

# 3. Current Campaign Position

The initial Yellow-era Kanto campaign is in active development.

Broad progression currently stands at:

**Pallet / Yellow Opening**  
→ **Viridian / Viridian Forest**  
→ **Pewter / Brock**  
→ **Route 3 / Mt. Moon**  
→ **Cerulean-era progression — ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT BOUNDARY**

The accepted gameplay baseline now extends into the Cerulean era through the Yellow Cerulean Rival #3 scene, retained Fame Checker handoff, and Partner-safe Rival choreography.

The immediate next implementation boundary is Route 24 Damian / Charmander gift integration.

| Viridian / early Route 2 / Viridian Forest | Implemented for current approved scope |
| Pewter / Brock / post-Brock progression | Implemented and accepted for current approved scope |
| Route 3 / Mt. Moon | Implemented and accepted |
| Cerulean / Route 24 / Route 25 / Bill | Active — Rival/Fame Checker accepted; Damian next |
| Vermilion / S.S. Anne / Lt. Surge | Pending staged audit and Yellow integration |

# 5. Established Foundation Systems

The following project foundations are already present and should be built upon rather than re-created independently.

## 5.1 Canonical Partner Pikachu

Golden Yellow distinguishes:

- canonical Partner Pikachu: `SPECIES_PIKACHU_STARTER`;
- ordinary Pikachu: `SPECIES_PIKACHU`.

Partner-aware systems resolve the canonical Partner specifically rather than treating every Pikachu as the Partner.

Current architecture includes persistent Partner following, Partner-specific restrictions, Partner-aware checkpoint reconstruction, and follower identity resolution by actual party Pokémon rather than assumed party slot.

## 5.2 Follower / Scripted Movement Foundation

The project has a follower-safe scripted movement mechanism for scenes that need Partner Pikachu to remain visible and continue following during controlled player/NPC choreography.

Battle-opening follower integration also uses actual resolved follower Pokémon identity so that only the Pokémon truly represented by the overworld follower receives the follower-style battle entrance.

## 5.3 Yellow Rival Eevee State

Persistent Yellow Rival branching exists for:

- Jolteon path;
- Flareon path;
- Vaporeon path.

The branch is established by the Oak Lab and optional early Route 22 battles and is intended to control later Yellow Rival progression.

Later Rival encounters must be audited at their story boundary rather than assumed complete merely because dispatch infrastructure exists.

## 5.4 Trainer Watch / Time Foundation

Trainer Watch and persistent time architecture exist as the early foundation for later Crystal-era time-sensitive systems.

## 5.5 Campaign Phase Foundation

Persistent campaign-phase architecture exists for the long-form progression from Yellow Kanto into Sevii, the time transition, Johto, later Kanto, and endgame.

The state architecture exists; the later campaigns themselves are not yet implemented merely because their phase constants exist.

## 5.6 Debug / Checkpoint Foundation

Golden Yellow debug checkpoints reconstruct story state for direct event testing.

A checkpoint is testing infrastructure only.

> **Checkpoint existence must never be treated as proof that the corresponding gameplay event is implemented or accepted.**

# 6. Established Design Decisions

These are broad project decisions, not individual acceptance records.

- Pokémon Yellow owns the initial Kanto narrative identity.
- FireRed/LeafGreen owns compatible GBA map architecture, presentation, facilities, and proven choreography where Yellow is silent.
- `pokeemerald-expansion` provides the modern systems baseline where compatible.
- Pokémon Crystal owns the later Johto narrative identity.
- TMs remain consumable; reusable TMs are not enabled.
- Modern battle systems remain active, including Natures, Abilities, IVs/EVs, held items, modern movesets, and the Physical/Special split.
- Compatible FireRed quality-of-life systems are retained unless they conflict with Yellow canon.
- Gen 1 and Gen 2 Pokémon must ultimately be obtainable in a self-contained single-player save.
- Trade-dependent evolutions must ultimately have single-player alternatives.
- Accepted gameplay should not be reopened without a regression or an explicitly approved redesign.

For the exact content of accepted milestones, use the Acceptance Log.

# 7. Accepted Story Boundary

The currently accepted Yellow story boundary reaches through:

- Yellow opening and Partner Pikachu foundation;
- Viridian early progression and Teachy TV integration;
- Pewter/Brock and follower-safe early scripted scenes;
- required Pewter Jigglypuff Partner reaction;
- Route 3 / Mt. Moon fossil progression;
- Jessie & James encounter #1;
- related follower/battle entrance integration validated after the Mt. Moon milestone;
- Cerulean Rival #3 Yellow integration;
- retained Fame Checker handoff after the Yellow Rival dialogue;
- Partner-safe Cerulean Rival approach, battle-return, and Fame Checker choreography.

The details, commits, workflow runs, and manual-validation notes for these milestones are maintained in `Pokemon_Golden_Yellow_Acceptance_Log.md` and any linked dedicated acceptance record.

---

# 8. Current Active Development Boundary — Cerulean Era

The Cerulean-era pass is active.

The Cerulean Rival #3 / Fame Checker integration is accepted. The immediate next implementation boundary is:

**Route 24 Damian / Charmander gift**

Remaining Cerulean-era scope includes:

1. Route 4 arrival and transition from Mt. Moon regression coverage.
2. Nugget Bridge and the Rocket recruiter sequence regression coverage.
3. Route 24 Damian / Charmander gift.
4. Route 25 progression.
5. Bill / Sea Cottage story sequence.
6. Required Partner Pikachu reaction to transformed/restored Bill.
7. Melanie / Bulbasaur gift using canonical Partner Pikachu happiness.
8. Misty / Cerulean Gym Yellow identity validation.
9. Cerulean exit progression toward Vermilion.

Before changing code for each remaining stage:

- resolve the live branch HEAD;
- inspect the exact affected live maps/scripts/data;
- compare Yellow canon against retained FRLG behavior;
- retain compatible FRLG implementation;
- add only the Yellow-specific overrides and integration required;
- confirm direct testing checkpoints for the events being developed.

---

# 9. Major Yellow Requirements Still Ahead

The following are examples of required Yellow content that remains ahead of the current accepted boundary.

## Cerulean era

- Damian's Charmander gift;
- Bill Partner Pikachu reaction;
- Melanie's Bulbasaur gift with canonical Partner happiness requirement;
- Misty Yellow battle identity validation.

## Vermilion era

- S.S. Anne Yellow Rival progression audit;
- required Pokémon Fan Club Partner Pikachu reaction;
- Lt. Surge Yellow battle identity audit;
- Officer Jenny's Squirtle gift after Lt. Surge / Thunder Badge.

## Later mandatory Partner reaction

- Pokémon Tower fear/unease reaction.

## Remaining Jessie & James encounters

1. Rocket Hideout B4F;
2. Pokémon Tower 7F;
3. Silph Co. 11F.

## Later Yellow campaign requirements

Additional Yellow-specific trainer, boss, legendary, gift, and narrative differences remain to be staged through the rest of Kanto.

Moltres must remain in Victory Road under the approved Yellow canon.

# 10. FireRed / Modern Retention Direction

Compatible modern systems remain part of Golden Yellow, including the current approved direction for:

- Running Shoes;
- Bicycle and Fly infrastructure;
- Fame Checker;
- Quest Log / resume behavior;
- Vs. Seeker;
- modern Bag organization;
- consumable TM handling with modern TM UI;
- Berries;
- Move Tutors and Move Reminder;
- modern Pokédex and PC systems;
- Pokémon Center and Mart systems;
- Sevii Islands and Celio progression;
- Sevii Rocket storyline;
- breeding facilities;
- League rematches.

Inherited presence in the base engine does not automatically mean a feature has been specifically validated for Golden Yellow. Audit systems when they become relevant to active story work.

---

# 11. Acceptance and Regression Policy

Manual gameplay acceptance is tracked in `Pokemon_Golden_Yellow_Acceptance_Log.md`.

The rules are:

- a successful build is necessary but does not by itself create an acceptance;
- explicit user gameplay validation controls final acceptance for tested scenes/features;
- accepted behavior remains part of the regression baseline unless a defect is found or redesign is explicitly approved;
- dedicated acceptance records may preserve detailed choreography or implementation history for complex milestones;
- Current Project State should not duplicate that detailed evidence.

---

# 12. Current Blockers

**No known blocking regression is open at this snapshot.**

The Cerulean Rival #3 / Fame Checker / Partner choreography milestone has passed manual acceptance.

Development can proceed to Damian's Route 24 Charmander gift from the accepted Cerulean Rival baseline.

---

# 13. Maintenance Rule

Acceptance closeout is governed by Hard Rule `DOC-006`.

Update this document when the **broad project boundary changes**, for example:

- a major story region moves from pending to active;
- an active region becomes broadly complete;
- a major foundation system is added or replaced;
- a blocker materially changes project direction;
- the campaign moves into a new phase.

Do **not** rewrite this document for every small accepted fix.

For each explicit gameplay acceptance, update `Pokemon_Golden_Yellow_Acceptance_Log.md` instead.
